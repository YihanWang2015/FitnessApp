Description:

Put in a goal, uses a phone's built in pedometer to count steps, STEPS MAN STEPS. Has calculations of distance and calories. 

We were planning on using the accelerometer or both the accelerometer and pedometer as options, but it is hard to do, and the pedometer is simpler and more efficient (because it is provided by google).

Known Issues

The pedometer is within an activity and not a fragment. Dang, so close.
